VULKAN TRANSLTOR

1. Uses a vulkan translation API to translate text into vulkan language. 
2. Utilises the functioning of fetch/innertext/value..etc many other functions of JS.
3. The API has a limit of 5 times per hour. Added a link to free API too(Banana language) incase the original API doesn't work.
4. For god's sake divyansh, don't add JS file at the beginning of HTML code as most of the time it'll through error.
